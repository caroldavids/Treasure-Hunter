This repo contains code for an Android phone application.  The application allows a user to select a BLE beacon by its major/minor identification. Visual and audible signals indicate the user's proximity to the selected beacon.  The face of the phone flashes red and the phone makes a low slow beeping sound when the user is far from the beacon.  The face of the phoen flashes blue and the phone emits  ahigh fast beeping sound when the user is close.  Intermediate colors and beeps indicate intermediary proximities.  The proimity is is based on the RSSI at which the beacon signal is received by the phone.
